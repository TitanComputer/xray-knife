`xray-knife` is a versatile multi-tool that streamlines the process of working with proxy configurations. Whether you need to test a list of servers for latency and speed, run a local proxy that automatically rotates to the fastest outbound, or scan for optimal edge IPs, `xray-knife` provides a robust and efficient solution.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Dual-Core Engine**: Seamlessly works with both `xray-core` and `sing-box`, automatically selecting the right core for each configuration type (VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, Hysteria2, WireGuard, etc.).

- **🔬 Advanced Proxy Tester**: Concurrently test thousands of configs for real latency, download/upload speed, and real IP information. Output results in clean `txt` or `csv` formats.

- **🔄 Auto-Rotating Proxy**: Run a local SOCKS/HTTP proxy that automatically finds the fastest, working outbound from your list and rotates it on a schedule or on-demand.

- **🌐 Powerful IP Scanner**: Discover optimal Cloudflare edge IPs (or other providers) by scanning entire CIDR ranges for latency and speed, helping you find the best connection points.

- **🔎 Universal Config Parser**: Decode any configuration link into a human-readable breakdown or generate a full, clean `xray-core` compatible JSON file for debugging or manual use.

- **📚 Subscription Manager**: Fetch, update, and manage configurations from remote subscription links with a single command.

- **💻 Cross-Platform**: A single, dependency-free binary available for Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android.

## 🛠️ Usage

`xray-knife` is a command-line tool with a clear and consistent command structure:
`xray-knife [command] [flags]`

Here are some flags :
```
  -b, --body                        Show trace body output
  -C, --config string               Use a config link as a proxy to test IPs
  -d, --download-mb int             Custom amount of data to download for speedtest (in MB) (default 20)
  -h, --help                        help for cfscanner
  -E, --insecure                    Allow insecure TLS connections for the proxy config (when using --config)
  -l, --live-output string          Live output file to save results as they are found (unsorted)
  -k, --only-speedtest              Only save results that have successful speedtest data (download or upload)
  -o, --output string               Output file to save sorted results (default "results.txt")
  -r, --retry int                   Number of times to retry TCP connection on failure (default 1)
  -i, --shuffle-ip                  Shuffle list of IPs
  -e, --shuffle-subnet              Shuffle list of Subnets
  -p, --speedtest                   Measure download/upload speed on the fastest IPs
      --speedtest-concurrency int   Number of concurrent speed tests to run (to avoid saturating bandwidth) (default 4)
      --speedtest-timeout int       Total timeout in seconds for one IP's speed test (download + upload) (default 30)
  -c, --speedtest-top int           Number of fastest IPs to select for speed testing (default 1000000)
  -s, --subnets string              Subnet or file containing subnets (e.g., "1.1.1.1/24,2.2.2.2/16")
  -t, --threads int                 Count of threads for latency scan (default 100)
  -u, --timeout int                 Individual request timeout (in ms) (default 5000)
  -m, --upload-mb int               Custom amount of data to upload for speedtest (in MB) (default 10)
  -v, --verbose                     Show verbose output with detailed errors
```

Here are some practical examples for the main commands.

---

### 🧪 Testing Configs (`http`)

Test a list of proxy configurations for latency, speed, and more.

**1. Basic Latency Test**
Test all configs from a file, using 50 concurrent threads, and save the working ones to `valid.txt`.
```bash
xray-knife http -f configs.txt -t 50 -o valid.txt
```

**2. Speed Test and CSV Output**
Perform a speed test, sort results by the fastest latency, and save a detailed report to a CSV file.
```bash
xray-knife http -f configs.txt --speedtest --sort --type csv -o results.csv
```

---

### 🔄 Auto-Rotating Proxy (`proxy`)

Run a local proxy that intelligently manages and rotates your outbound connections.

**1. Run a Rotating SOCKS5 Proxy**
Start a local SOCKS5 proxy on port `9999`. It will test configs from `configs.txt` and automatically rotate to the best-performing one every 5 minutes (300 seconds).
```bash
xray-knife proxy -f configs.txt --port 9999 --rotate 300
```
> **Pro Tip:** While the proxy is running, simply press `Enter` to force an immediate rotation to the next available fast configuration.

**2. Use a Single, Static Config**
Run the proxy using just one configuration link without rotation.
```bash
xray-knife proxy -c "vless://..." --port 9999
```

---

### 🌐 Scanning for Cloudflare IPs (`scanner cfscanner`)

Find the fastest Cloudflare edge IPs for your location.

**1. Scan a Subnet with Speed Test**
Scan a CIDR subnet with 100 threads, including a speed test for each IP, and save the sorted results.
```bash
xray-knife scanner cfscanner -s "104.16.0.0/16" -t 100 -p -o cf_results.txt
```

**2. Scan from a File with Live Output**
Scan multiple subnets from a file (`subnets.txt`) and save results to `live_results.txt` as they are found (unsorted), in addition to the final sorted file.
```bash
xray-knife scanner cfscanner -s subnets.txt -t 200 -l live_results.txt -o final_results.txt
```

---

### 🔎 Parsing a Config Link (`parse`)

Decode and inspect any configuration link.

**1. Get a Human-Readable Breakdown**
Display a detailed, easy-to-read summary of a configuration link.
```bash
xray-knife parse -c "trojan://..."
```

**2. Generate Full JSON Config**
Generate a complete, clean, and ready-to-use `xray-core` compatible JSON configuration. This is perfect for debugging or use with other tools.
```bash
xray-knife parse -c "vless://..." --json > my_config.json
```

---

### 📚 Fetching Subscriptions (`subs fetch`)

Download and save all configurations from a subscription link.
```bash
xray-knife subs fetch -u "https://example.com/sub/link" -o my_configs.txt
```
